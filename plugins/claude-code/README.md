# Sigil Security Plugin for Claude Code

Automated security auditing for AI agent code directly in Claude Code.

## Features

- **🔍 Scan Repositories** - Audit entire repos for malicious patterns before cloning
- **📦 Package Auditing** - Check npm and pip packages for supply-chain threats
- **📄 File Analysis** - Scan individual files or code selections
- **🛡️ Quarantine Workflow** - Review and approve/reject findings with risk scores
- **🤖 Security Agents** - Specialized AI agents for threat analysis and quarantine management

## What Gets Scanned?

Sigil analyzes **6 threat categories** with severity weighting:

| Phase | What It Detects | Severity |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| **Install Hooks** | `setup.py` cmdclass, npm `postinstall`, Makefile targets | Critical (10x) |
| **Code Patterns** | `eval()`, `exec()`, `pickle`, `child_process`, dynamic imports | High (5x) |
| **Network/Exfil** | Outbound HTTP, webhooks, socket connections, DNS tunneling | High (3x) |
| **Credentials** | ENV var access, API keys, SSH keys, AWS credentials | Medium (2x) |
| **Obfuscation** | Base64 decode, charCode, hex encoding, minified payloads | High (5x) |
| **Provenance** | Shallow git history, binary files, hidden files, author count | Low (1-3x) |

## Risk Scoring

| Score | Verdict | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 0 | **CLEAN** | Auto-approve (configurable) |
| 1–9 | **LOW RISK** | Approve with review |
| 10–24 | **MEDIUM RISK** | Manual review required |
| 25–49 | **HIGH RISK** | Blocked, requires override |
| 50+ | **CRITICAL** | Blocked, no override |

## Usage

### Skills (Invoke with `/`)

The plugin provides 4 skills for security scanning:

#### 1. Scan Repository
```
/sigil-security:scan-repo /path/to/repo
```

Audits an entire repository for malicious patterns across all files.

**Example:**
```
/sigil-security:scan-repo ~/projects/untrusted-mcp-server
```

#### 2. Scan Package
```
/sigil-security:scan-package <package-name>
```

Downloads and scans an npm or pip package before installation.

**Examples:**
```
/sigil-security:scan-package lodash
/sigil-security:scan-package requests
```

#### 3. Scan File
```
/sigil-security:scan-file /path/to/file.py
```

Analyzes a specific file for security vulnerabilities.

**Example:**
```
/sigil-security:scan-file ./src/agent/tools.ts
```

#### 4. Quarantine Review
```
/sigil-security:quarantine-review
```

Reviews all quarantined items and helps decide whether to approve or reject.

### Agents

The plugin includes 2 specialized security agents:

#### 🔍 security-auditor

Expert security auditor for analyzing Sigil scan results and identifying threats.

**When to use:**
- Analyzing scan findings
- Understanding risk scores
- Getting remediation recommendations
- Assessing false positives

**Invoke with:**
```
@security-auditor analyze these scan results
```

#### 🛡️ quarantine-manager

Manages the quarantine workflow and guides approval/rejection decisions.

**When to use:**
- Reviewing quarantined items
- Making approve/reject decisions
- Understanding quarantine status
- Coordinating multi-finding reviews

**Invoke with:**
```
@quarantine-manager review the latest quarantine
```

### Automated Recommendations

The plugin includes hooks that auto-suggest Sigil when you:

- Mention "clone", "install", "package", "security", "scan", or "malware"
- Use commands like `git clone`, `pip install`, or `npm install`

Claude Code will automatically recommend using Sigil's quarantine-first workflow.

## Examples

### Scan a Suspicious MCP Server

```
User: I want to install this MCP server from GitHub: https://github.com/someone/cool-mcp

Claude: Before installing, let me scan this with Sigil for security threats.

/sigil-security:scan-repo https://github.com/someone/cool-mcp

[Sigil scans the repository]

🔍 SCAN RESULTS: HIGH RISK

Risk Score: 32 / 100
Threat Level: HIGH

📋 Findings:
1. Install Hook Detected - npm postinstall script executes on install
   Location: package.json:15
   Severity: 10x (CRITICAL)

2. Network Exfiltration - HTTP POST to unknown endpoint
   Location: src/index.ts:47
   Severity: 3x (HIGH)

💡 Analysis:
The postinstall hook executes immediately when you run `npm install`,
sending data to an external server. This is a common supply-chain attack pattern.

✅ Recommendations:
- DO NOT APPROVE this package
- Find an alternative MCP server from a trusted source
- Report this package to the maintainer if it's a known repository

🛡️ Decision: REJECT

Would you like me to suggest alternative MCP servers?
```

### Review a Clean Package

```
User: Can I safely install the requests library?

Claude: Let me scan it first to confirm it's safe.

/sigil-security:scan-package requests

[Sigil scans the package]

🔍 SCAN RESULTS: CLEAN

Risk Score: 0 / 100
Threat Level: CLEAN

📋 Findings:
No security threats detected.

💡 Analysis:
The requests library is a well-maintained, widely-used HTTP library
from the Python community. No malicious patterns found.

✅ Recommendations:
- Safe to install
- Official PyPI package
- 50M+ downloads/month, trusted maintainer

🛡️ Decision: APPROVE

You can install with:
```bash
pip install requests
```
```

### Quarantine Management

```
User: What's in my quarantine right now?

Claude: Let me check your quarantine status.

/sigil-security:quarantine-review

@quarantine-manager

[Quarantine Manager lists items]

📦 QUARANTINE REVIEW

3 items currently quarantined:

1. **suspicious-ai-toolkit** (npm)
   Scan ID: abc123
   Risk Score: 45 / 100 (HIGH)
   Findings: Install hook + eval usage

2. **helper-utils** (pip)
   Scan ID: def456
   Risk Score: 12 / 100 (MEDIUM)
   Findings: Base64 encoding detected

3. **github.com/user/agent-tool** (git)
   Scan ID: ghi789
   Risk Score: 3 / 100 (LOW)
   Findings: Single HTTP request in tests

🎯 Recommendations:
- abc123 (suspicious-ai-toolkit): REJECT - Multiple critical threats
- def456 (helper-utils): REVIEW - Likely false positive (base64 is common)
- ghi789 (agent-tool): APPROVE - Low risk, HTTP in test suite

Commands:
```bash
sigil reject abc123
sigil approve def456  # after reviewing code
sigil approve ghi789
```

Would you like me to analyze any specific item in detail?
```

## Configuration

### Default Agent

The plugin sets `security-auditor` as the default agent. To change this, create a `settings.json` in your Claude Code config:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "sigil-security": {
      "agent": "quarantine-manager"
    }
  }
}
```

### Auto-Approve Threshold

Configure in your Sigil CLI settings (`~/.sigil/config.yaml`):

```yaml
quarantine:
  auto_approve_threshold: 0  # Only auto-approve CLEAN (0)
  # auto_approve_threshold: 9  # Auto-approve CLEAN and LOW (0-9)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Sigil command not found"

The Sigil CLI must be installed first. See [Installation](#prerequisites).

```bash
# Verify installation
which sigil
sigil --version
```

### Skills not showing up

Verify plugin installation:

```bash
claude plugin list
```

Should show:
```
sigil-security@1.0.0 (enabled)
```

### Hooks not triggering

Check Claude Code version:

```bash
claude --version
```

Requires Claude Code 1.0.33 or later.
