  Automated security auditing for AI agent code. Scans repos, packages, MCP
  servers, and installed skills for malicious patterns using eight-phase
  analysis: install hooks, dangerous code patterns, network exfiltration,
  credential access, obfuscation, provenance, prompt injection, and skill
  security. Use when: cloning repos, installing
  packages, reviewing MCP servers, auditing skills, scanning code before
  execution, or when asked to check if something is safe, audit code, scan
  for malware, review dependencies.
compatibility: Requires internet for initial setup only. All scanning is local and offline. Works on macOS (arm64/x64), Linux (x64), and WSL.

# Sigil Security Scanner

Sigil provides eight-phase security analysis purpose-built for AI agent code. It detects install hooks, dangerous code patterns, network exfiltration, credential access, obfuscation, provenance issues, prompt injection attacks, and AI skill security threats.

## When to Activate

Invoke this skill in ANY of these situations:

- Before cloning any repository with `git clone`
- Before installing any package with `pip install` or `npm install`
- When the user asks to "scan", "audit", "check", or "review" code
- When the user asks "is this safe?" or "is this malicious?"
- When reviewing MCP server configurations
- When the user mentions supply chain security, dependency auditing, or code safety
- When any unfamiliar repo, package, or skill is about to be used

## Setup

Before first use, verify the Sigil CLI binary is installed:

```bash
bash <skill_root>/scripts/setup.sh
```

Parse the JSON stdout. On success: `{"installed": true, "version": "...", "path": "..."}`. On failure: `{"error": true, "message": "..."}`. If setup fails, present the error to the user and suggest manual installation: `brew install nomarj/tap/sigil`, `npm install -g @nomark/sigil`, or `cargo install sigil-cli`.

## Core Scan

To scan any target, run:

```bash
bash <skill_root>/scripts/scan.sh <target>
```

The `<target>` argument accepts:
- **Local path**: `/path/to/project` or `./src`
- **GitHub URL**: `https://github.com/owner/repo`
- **GitHub shorthand**: `owner/repo`
- **npm package**: `@scope/package` or `npm:package-name`
- **pip package**: `pip:package-name`
- **Any URL**: `https://example.com/file.py`

### Output Format

The script outputs a single JSON object to stdout:

```json
{
  "verdict": "HIGH RISK",
  "score": 37,
  "target": "github.com/someone/sketchy-mcp-server",
  "files_scanned": 142,
  "duration_ms": 85,
  "findings_count": 12,
  "phases": {
    "InstallHooks": { "findings": 2, "severity": "critical" },
    "CodePatterns": { "findings": 5, "severity": "high" },
    "NetworkExfil": { "findings": 1, "severity": "medium" },
    "Credentials": { "findings": 3, "severity": "high" },
    "Obfuscation": { "findings": 0, "severity": "clean" },
    "Provenance": { "findings": 1, "severity": "low" },
    "PromptInjection": { "findings": 0, "severity": "clean" },
    "SkillSecurity": { "findings": 0, "severity": "clean" }
  },
  "findings": [
    {
      "phase": "InstallHooks",
      "severity": "Critical",
      "weight": 10,
      "rule": "INSTALL-003",
      "file": "package.json",
      "line": 8,
      "snippet": "postinstall script detected: node malicious.js"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Interpreting Results

**Always present the verdict prominently to the user.**

| Verdict | Score | Action |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `LOW RISK` | 0-9 | Proceed. Note that low risk does not mean zero risk. Inform the user of the result. |
| `MEDIUM RISK` | 10-24 | Show findings to the user. Ask for explicit approval before proceeding with any installation or execution. |
| `HIGH RISK` | 25-49 | Show detailed findings. Recommend rejection. Do NOT proceed without explicit user approval. |
| `CRITICAL RISK` | 50+ | Show all findings prominently. Strongly recommend rejection. Never auto-proceed. |

### Presenting Findings

When presenting findings to the user:
1. Group findings by phase (Install Hooks first — they are the most dangerous)
2. Show the severity, rule ID, file path with line number, and description for each finding
3. Highlight any `Critical` severity findings in the `InstallHooks` phase — these indicate code that runs automatically during installation
4. For reference on what each rule detects, read `<skill_root>/references/PHASES.md`
5. For details on how scoring works, read `<skill_root>/references/SCORING.md`

### Exit Codes

- `0`: LOW RISK (score 0-9)
- Non-zero: MEDIUM RISK or higher

## Environment Audit

To scan the developer's local environment for exposed credentials:

```bash
bash <skill_root>/scripts/audit-env.sh
```

This checks:
- `.env` files in the current project for exposed API keys, secrets, and tokens
- Home directory credential files (`~/.aws/credentials`, `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `~/.kube/config`, etc.) for insecure permissions
- Shell history files for accidentally leaked secrets
- Agent-accessible directories for credential files

Present all findings to the user. Flag any `critical` severity items prominently.

## Installed Skills Audit

To scan all installed skills across all agent directories:

```bash
bash <skill_root>/scripts/audit-skills.sh
```

This enumerates skills in: `~/.agents/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.cursor/skills/`, `~/.roo/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/`, and other agent paths. Each skill is scanned and assigned a risk verdict.

Present the results as a summary table showing each skill's name, agent, verdict, and score. Highlight any skills with `HIGH RISK` or `CRITICAL RISK` verdicts.

## Report Generation

To format scan results as a readable markdown report:

```bash
bash <skill_root>/scripts/scan.sh <target> | bash <skill_root>/scripts/report.sh
```

Or from a saved JSON file:

```bash
bash <skill_root>/scripts/report.sh results.json
```

## Important Behavioural Rules

1. **Never describe code as "safe" or "malicious" in definitive terms.** Use "low risk", "elevated risk", "flagged patterns", or "detected patterns" instead.
2. **Always present the risk verdict and score** before any other commentary.
3. **When a scan returns HIGH RISK or CRITICAL RISK**, always show the detailed findings. Never summarise away critical findings.
4. **For CRITICAL RISK findings in the InstallHooks phase**, explicitly warn the user that install-time code execution was detected — this means code runs automatically when the package is installed, before the user can review it.
5. **Wait for explicit user approval** before proceeding with installation or execution of any target rated MEDIUM RISK or higher.
6. **Include the disclaimer** at the end of scan result presentations: "Sigil provides risk assessments based on automated pattern detection. Risk assessments do not constitute a guarantee of security or a definitive determination of malicious intent."
